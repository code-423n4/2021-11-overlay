So it looks like there might be more duplicate issues coming in regarding the lack of total supply incremeting and decrementing in the transferMint/Burn functions. Just want to offer some context regarding that, here I replied to the first issue that was filed -

The findings repo will remain private until after the contest, when the report is ready to publish -- so wardens won't be able to view that link 🙂 But there's a bit of intel for those of you who were planning on submitting that issue!
